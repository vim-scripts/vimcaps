vimcaps
Never be bothered by caps lock.

As is known, capslock is almost useless in vim&#039s normal mode. If it happens that the capslock is locked, you know what the fuck is going to happen:

+ You want to move up, but came out a man;
+ You wanna move down, but line joins;
+ You try to undo those joins, but it undo itself;
+ ...

So, lots of vimmers disabled the capslock or map it to another key. Yes, that is a beautiful solution. I don&#039t like capslock too. But someday, I notice that the capslock is still useful, ---if you have to use an on screen keyboard (e.g., with a touch screen) Then I decide to do a simple thing instead of remap the keyboard: Toggle off the capslock when back to normal mode, ---that is what this plugin do.

vimcaps now only support Windows, Linux support will be added later. Since I don&#039t have a mac, there won&#039t be any mac support until someone send a pull request. :)

Usage:
After install, this plugin will automatically handle the capslock for you: vimcaps register autocmd for toggle off the capslock when InsertLeave, BufferWinEnter and FocusGained. Note that FocusGained may don't work if you are under a terminal.

Starting from 0.0.3, vimcaps provide a function vimcaps#statusline() in order to display the keyboard locks status on the statusline. You'll need to add it to your statusline settings to enable it.

set stl=...%{vimcaps#statusline(N)}...
